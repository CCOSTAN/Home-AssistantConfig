# [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CCOSTAN/Home-AssistantConfig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CCOSTAN/Home-AssistantConfig) Home-Assistant Config by [@ccostan](http://www.twitter.com/ccostan)
[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration files (YAMLs)

Be sure to :star: my repo so you can keep up to date on the daily progress!

All of my Scripts are in this directory.  These scripts can be used over and over by different automations.  I try to modulize most of my scripts so that they can be passed variables from different automations and still keep all the settings normailized and centralized.
