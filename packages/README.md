Be sure to :star: my repo so you can keep up to date on the daily progress!

This section is for the packages.  (It's being slowly built out)

**Alarm System**
You can find out about how I swapped out my ADT for 3 NodeMCUs [here](http://www.vmwareinfo.com/2017/06/building-my-home-alarm-system-hardware.html).

**Landscape Lighting**
For the ladnscape lights, I have 2 12v transformers in the backyard. One powers the front landscape lights and the other the backyard landscaping lights.
I have put 2 [GE ZWave Outdoor Power Module](http://amzn.to/2q17R4S) conneted to the transformers and controlled by my [Wink Hub](http://amzn.to/2orGEWo).  They are set to turn on landscape lighting at sunset and turn off at random times before sunrise.
