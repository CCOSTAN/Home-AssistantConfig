# Dashboards Scratchpad

Current working items:
- Keep YAML dashboards rendering (no missing includes/resources).
- Validate dashboards before restarting Home Assistant.

Patterns/notes:
- If a view looks like a centered skinny column, avoid `max_columns: 1`. Prefer `max_columns: 4` with a single section/card using `columns: 1`.
