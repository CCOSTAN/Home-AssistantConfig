# Garage Garbage Day Reminders - staggered reminders after door opens
#  On garbage days, announce at 30s/90s/180s if the garage stays open.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Notes: Uses Alexa announce in the garage for local playback; also sends
#  one inside reminder via `script.speech_engine` (Chromecasts).
# Notes: Debounced garage door open trigger to avoid restarts if the
#  garage door state flaps (noisy sensors/reflection).
