This is fork of pyzeroconf, Multicast DNS Service Discovery for Python,
originally by Paul Scott-Murphy (https://github.com/paulsm/pyzeroconf),
modified by William McBrine (https://github.com/wmcbrine/pyzeroconf).

The original William McBrine's fork note::

    This fork is used in all of my TiVo-related projects: HME for Python
    (and therefore HME/VLC), Network Remote, Remote Proxy, and pyTivo.
    Before this, I was tracking the changes for zeroconf.py in three
    separate repos. I figured I should have an authoritative source.

    Although I make changes based on my experience with TiVos, I expect that
    they're generally applicable. This version also includes patches found
    on the now-defunct (?) Launchpad repo of pyzeroconf, and elsewhere
    around the net -- not always well-documented, sorry.

Compatible with:

* Bonjour
* Avahi

Compared to some other Zeroconf/Bonjour/Avahi Python packages, python-zeroconf:

* isn't tied to Bonjour or Avahi
* doesn't use D-Bus
* doesn't force you to use particular event loop or Twisted
* is pip-installable
* has PyPI distribution

Python compatibility
--------------------

* CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.3+
* PyPy 2.2+ (possibly 1.9-2.1 as well)
* PyPy3 2.4+

Versioning
----------

This project's versions follow the following pattern: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

* MAJOR version has been 0 so far
* MINOR version is incremented on backward incompatible changes
* PATCH version is incremented on backward compatible changes

Status
------

There are some people using this package. I don't actively use it and as such
any help I can offer with regard to any issues is very limited.


How to get python-zeroconf?
===========================

* PyPI page https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zeroconf
* GitHub project https://github.com/jstasiak/python-zeroconf

The easiest way to install python-zeroconf is using pip::

    pip install zeroconf



How do I use it?
================

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    from six.moves import input
    from zeroconf import ServiceBrowser, Zeroconf


    class MyListener(object):

        def remove_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):
            print("Service %s removed" % (name,))

        def add_service(self, zeroconf, type, name):
            info = zeroconf.get_service_info(type, name)
            print("Service %s added, service info: %s" % (name, info))


    zeroconf = Zeroconf()
    listener = MyListener()
    browser = ServiceBrowser(zeroconf, "_http._tcp.local.", listener)
    try:
        input("Press enter to exit...\n\n")
    finally:
        zeroconf.close()

.. note::

    Discovery and service registration use *all* available network interfaces by default.
    If you want to customize that you need to specify ``interfaces`` argument when
    constructing ``Zeroconf`` object (see the code for details).

If you don't know the name of the service you need to browse for, try:

.. code-block:: python

    from zeroconf import ZeroconfServiceTypes
    print('\n'.join(ZeroconfServiceTypes.find()))

See examples directory for more.
